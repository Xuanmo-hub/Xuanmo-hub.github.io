	<p style="font-size:16px">Astronautics (or cosmology) is the practice of sending spacecraft out of the Earth's atmosphere and into outer space. Space flight is one of its main applications, and space science is its core field.As in aerospace engineering, limitations on mass, temperature, and external forces require that space applications withstand extreme conditions: the high vacuum, the radiation bombardment of interplanetary space, and the magnetic field of low Earth orbit. Space launch vehicles must withstand enormous external forces, and satellites experience large temperature changes in a very short period of time. [5] The extreme constraints on mass force force aerospace engineers to continuously save mass in their designs to maximize the actual payload that can reach orbit.</p>

	<li style="font-size:16px">This website is divided into two main sections: highlighting important moments in the history of spaceflight and commemorating some of the astronauts who sacrificed their lives in the service of human spaceflight. </li>
	<li style="font-size:16px">Our goal is to educate more people about spaceflight and inspire students to explore it. Perhaps you, sitting here in front of this screen, are a future astronaut.</li>
	<li style="font-size:16px">At the same time, many unsung heroes sacrificed their lives throughout this development. We cannot know every one of them, but I will do my best to honor them.</li>
