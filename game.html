	<p style="color: white;">The battlecruiser's propulsion system allows it to enter warp space and achieve speeds faster than the speed of light. However, if the drive fails, it can lead to catastrophic consequences, such as a huge explosion that will completely destroy the entire battleship and the crew inside. In addition to conventional safety measures, some cruisers are equipped with a second set of short-range warp drives to share the load of the main drive. It also serves as an emergency plan - for example, if a high-risk "blind jump" is required to evacuate the war zone. Due to the shorter distance, it also reduces the risk of the cruiser and its crew ending up in a distant and unknown star field.</p>

	<p style="color: white;">For millennia, the Protoss have studied the nature of space and time, uncovering many of the mysteries of the universe. Through the art of psionic refinement, the Protoss have mastered the creation of autonomous mechanical brains, stored within advanced lattice molecules. These "crystal brains" can manipulate matter and energy with a precision unmatched by the brains of ordinary creatures. Warp Prisms are primarily used to transport troops on the battlefield, but they can also enter Phasing Mode, recharging nearby structures when necessary. In Phasing Mode, Warp Prisms can temporarily replace damaged crystal pillars or rapidly expand them.</p>
