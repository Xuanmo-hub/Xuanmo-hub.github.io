			<h3><b>Wormholes</b></h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Theory: According to general relativity, spacetime is not perfectly flat but can become highly curved under extreme conditions. Theoretical models suggest that if two locations in spacetime are connected by an Einsteinâ€“Rosen bridge, a "wormhole" can form. Such a passage can traverse vast distances in normal three-dimensional space in a very short time. To create a traversable wormhole, negative energy density is required to prevent collapse and maintain stability.</li>
				<li>Difficulty: Wormhole has not yet been experimentally confirmed; even if it exists, its stability, transport destination, and energy requirements remain unknown.</li>
				<li>Sci-fi Application: In the film "Interstellar," a stable wormhole near Saturn's orbit allows humans to travel across galaxies.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><b>Gravity Slingshot</b></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Theory: Based on orbital dynamics based on Newtonian mechanics and general relativity, a spacecraft approaching a massive object can change its relative velocity and direction by exchanging energy and momentum with its gravitational field. This process essentially exploits the object's orbital momentum in a subtle way, giving the spacecraft additional kinetic energy without consuming additional fuel. Under extreme conditions, a supermassive black hole can provide a gravitational boost far exceeding that of a planet, but this requires precise control to avoid damage from gravitational tidal effects.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Real-world applications: The Voyager, Galileo, and Cassini probes all relied on Jupiter, Saturn, and other planets for multiple gravity assists, significantly reducing energy consumption and extending mission range.</li>
				<li>Sci-fi extension: The Endurance rover in "Interstellar" used the gravitational field of the black hole Gargantua for acceleration and orbital adjustments.</li>

			<h3><b>Arificial Hibernation</b></h3>
			<img class="img3" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRH0uqcVLbQuEv2eAIfGbjG2N23Z9Kq5CCHWQ&s">
			<ul>
				<li>Theory: Drawing on the hibernation mechanisms of mammals, the approach involves inducing therapeutic hypothermia or pharmacological metabolic inhibition to significantly reduce the body's metabolic rate, thereby reducing oxygen and energy requirements. Theoretically, if a prolonged period of low-temperature metabolic state can be achieved while maintaining cellular integrity, individuals could maintain a physiologically reversible "hibernation" state during voyages lasting decades.</li>
				<li>Sci-fi extension: In Interstellar, hibernation technology is used to save astronauts' lives and reduce psychological stress during long-distance interstellar voyages.</li>
