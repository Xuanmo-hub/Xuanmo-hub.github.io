				<p>In the mid-21st century, dust storms and widespread crop blight have brought humanity to the brink of extinction. Joseph Cooper, a widowed NASA test pilot, now makes a living as a farmer and raises his two children, Murphy and Tom, with his father-in-law, Donald. Cooper is reprimanded by Murphy's teacher for telling him that the Apollo program wasn't fabricated.During a dust storm, the two discover that dust patterns in Murphy's room (which Murphy initially attributed to ghosts) are caused by gravitational anomalies and can be converted into geographic coordinates. These discoveries lead them to a secret NASA facility led by Professor John Brand, who explains that 48 years ago, a wormhole opened near Saturn, leading to another star system with 12 potentially habitable planets near a black hole called Gargantua.Lazarus Expedition volunteers had previously traveled through wormholes to assess planets, and three of them—Miller, Edmonds, and Mann—reported promising results. </p>

				<p>Cooper is tasked with piloting the spacecraft Endurance through a wormhole as part of a mission to colonize a habitable planet with 5,000 frozen embryos,ensuring humanity's survival.Meanwhile, Professor Brand will continue his work attempting to solve a gravitational equation whose solution purportedly will allow the construction of a spacecraft for human evacuation from Earth. Despite Murphy's objections,Cooper accepts the mission and promises to return. When Murphy refuses to see him off, he leaves his watch with her so they can compare their relative times upon their return.The crew, consisting of Cooper, the robots TARS and CASE, and scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Romilly, and Doyle, travel through the wormhole after a two-year journey to Saturn. Cooper, Doyle, and Brand use a lander to explore Miller's planet, a place with severe time dilation. The lander lands in knee-deep water, discovering only the remains of Miller's expedition. A massive tidal wave then engulfs Doyle and floods the lander's engines.</p>

	<div><p>Cooper watched Tom grow up, marry, and lose his first son. The adult Murphy is now a scientist working with Professor Brand on the gravitational equations. On his deathbed, Professor Brand admitted that the Endurance crew should never have returned because he knew it would be impossible to fully solve the equations without observing the gravitational singularity from inside a black hole.On Mann's planet, they awakened him from cryogenic slumber, and he assured them that despite the extreme conditions, colonization was possible. During a reconnaissance mission, Mann attempted to kill Cooper and revealed that he had falsified data in the hope of being rescued. He stole Cooper's lander and headed for the Endurance. A booby trap set by Mann killed Romilly, while Brand rescued Cooper using another lander, and they flew back to the Endurance. Mann was killed in a failed manual docking maneuver, and the Endurance was severely damaged, but Cooper regained control of the station through his own docking maneuver.Low on fuel, Cooper and Brand are forced to use a slingshot to circumvent Gargantua, but due to time dilation, this takes 51 years. During this process, Cooper and TARS jettison the lander to lighten the Endurance so that Brand and Case can reach Edmonds' planet. They plummet through Gargantua's event horizon and are ejected from the spacecraft, finding themselves in a hypercube composed of countless replicas of Murphy's bedroom, stretched across the boundaries of time. Cooper deduces that the hypercube was constructed by advanced humans from the distant future and realizes that he has been Murphy's "ghost" all along.He used Morse code to manipulate the second hand of the watch he gave to Murphy before leaving, providing her with the data collected by TARS, enabling her to complete Professor Brand's solution.</p><p style="font-size:10px;">From wikipidia[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)]</p></div>
